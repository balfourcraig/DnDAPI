    'This tavern is the hangout of dangerous gang. The locals all stay away, but travelers sometimes blunder in by mistake. The ruffians inside are silently estimating the party\'s ability to defend itself.',
    'This tavern is the stronghold of a powerful vampire. The vampire plays the part of the charismatic bartender, and the staff are all living thralls. The vampire is a shrewd predator, selecting isolated victims who will not be immediately missed.',
    'This tavern is hanging in the precarious silence of imminent violence. A corrupt sheriff and several deputies have confronted a criminal cell over a betrayed alliance. Threats of violence were spoken moments before the party walked in the door.',
    'This tavern is hosting a secret gathering of local doppelgängers. The creatures meet once a month under the guise of a card tournament, and when the party enters, furtive looks are exchanged. Having partially infiltrated the community they have come to love the folksy non-shape changing inhabitants and now wish to live in peace. They are afraid of what might happen if the PCs discover what they truly are.',
    'This tavern is being visited by an indiscrete noble having an affair. The noble is upstairs with their lover. In the common room are several members of the noble\'s staff as well as many local folks who have pocketed pouches of gold to stay silent. There is an air of exaggerated nonchalance.',
    'This tavern is being robbed. The owners are being held at knifepoint in another room. The robbers have decided that the best way through is to play the part of the wait staff and wait for the party to leave.',
    'This tavern\'s flaws are being concealed by illusions. Desperate to impress a wealthy buyer, the owner has enlisted a wizard friend in covering up the establishment\'s many, sometimes dangerous, deficiencies. Glamers conceal holes in the floor, vermin, shabby furniture, and hideous dishes.',
    'This tavern is secretly serving rat meat. Unable to secure affordable proteins, the owner has procured several giant rat carcasses from a local hunter. The staff is uncomfortably maintaining the charade with lame excuses about the flavor of the food.',
    'This tavern is trafficking sentients. Local prohibition laws have turned this tavern into an inn. To make ends meet, the tavernkeep has begun taking travelers in their sleep and selling them to smugglers. Victims are kept a few days in a basement until the next pickup. Rumors in the community and odd stray belongings provide clues to the true nature of the establishment.',
    'This tavern is defended by mimics. The barkeep has several domesticated mimics masquerading as diners\' tables. The mimics live on the table scraps plus unsold food. The locals know about this, and deliberately leave meals unfinished. Despite this, the "tables" stomachs sometimes growl when food is served. The protective creatures are also quick to act if they believe their master is being threatened.',
    'This tavern is a hub of spycraft. This location has long been a meeting place for spies to meet, make deals, and exchange information. Local folks come and go from the place without harassment, but unusual patrons, like traveling adventurers, are slyly and thoroughly investigated. [u/snakebite262]',
    'This tavern makes people fat. A hag with a longstanding grudge has cursed the kitchen of this tavern. The food produced here is delicious, but supernaturally fattening. All the local patrons are obese, but eat ravenously. Staying in the establishment and eating even a single meal causes a diner to gain 2d10 pounds. When the hag spies a properly-fattened victim, she steals the person away to a grim fate.',
    'This tavern is run by a murderous devil swine. This tavern has a reputation for debauchery, but few know that the owner is an evil lycanthrope. The devil swine eats one or more of the house\'s partiers nightly. Each day, the remains are butchered and fed back to the patrons. The staff of the tavern are cultists of the beast god, desperate to become devil swine themselves.',
    'This tavern facilitates communication with devilkin. The special mead served here allows communication with devils. The imbiber appears to enter a drunken stupor, but is being contacted by extraplanar monsters. The tavern is run by a cult that uses the mead to receive instructions their master, a fiend. Cultists sometimes recommend the "special mead" to individuals they believe could prove useful for the devils.',
    'This tavern facilitates kidnappings from beyond. The basement of this tavern contains a well leading into the Underdark, or a portal to another plane. The owners of the building have made arrangements with creatures from beyond their realm, allowing them access to enter the tavern during the night and steal whatever persons match their unfathomable tastes.',
    'This tavern is staffed by people possessed by ghosts. A century ago, the family that ran this tavern all died in a fire. In time, their spirits came to possess living hosts, whom they have forced to rebuild their home and act out their former lives. Now the tavern is a successful business. However, the staff can sometimes be seen weeping for no reason, or staring blankly for minutes at a time. The hosts are still trapped within their bodies, desperate for escape.',
    'This tavern is the toy project of wealthy nobles. All the workers in this establishment are nobles who cheerfully enjoy playing at labor, though much of the real work is done by servants. Some of the decisions and pricing are quirky, but it could be politically dangerous to criticize the “staff”. [u/gnurdette]',
    'This tavern exists in multiple places. The clientele within this place is highly diverse. While they all share the same space inside, when they leave, they exit back onto whatever street in whatever land they originated from. Because of this, it cannot be used as a form of travel, except by a special method known only to the mysterious, smiling tavernkeeper.',
    'This tavern is a temple to a god of mead and revelry. The tavern is staffed by a sect of gregarious priests who consider it their holy duty to provide alcohol without charge. They do, however, consider it a grave insult for those who imbibe to leave before becoming wildly intoxicated.',
    'This tavern is a front for investigators. A group dedicated to wiping out corruption built this tavern specifically to acquire evidence against nobles and government officials. The tavern is secretly staffed by retired law enforcement officers and journalists, and is replete with scrying devices and hidden observation chambers. Adventurers might be shooed away, or asked to aid in surveillance.',
    'This tavern is also the entrance to a dungeon. When the entrance to a vast dungeon was recently discovered, the owner of this tavern built his establishment right on top of it. Patrons can rent a room and load up on basic supplies before their delve. There is a fee to enter, but as customers are reminded, they get to keep whatever they find!',
    'This tavern is an intellectual hub. This tavern is empty when the PCs arrive, but slowly begins to fill up with robed patrons. This is the favored watering hole of several prominent sages and scholars. This is a site of intense intellectual debate and discussion, and they will not tolerate rowdiness of any kind.',
    'This tavern is serving tainted food. There are clues about for anyone who is paying attention- the chef coughs when they call out to the watrons, a drunk is complaining about his stomach, and a few of the dishes seem off. It\'s an easily-avoided pitfall, but everyone eating here tonight is about to have a very unpleasant food poisoning experience.',
    'This tavern is about to be attacked by the king\'s men. A couple of hours ago, the prince and some of his friends, slumming incognito, picked a fight here and were badly beaten. The prince has dispatched a group of soldiers to take revenge on everyone in the tavern, and they are arriving soon.',
    'This tavern is mounted on wheels. This oddity of a tavern is a delight to many. It travels, slowly, all over the continent, the old-fashioned way: pulled by a large team of oxen. The wheeled undercarriage can be mistaken by patrons arriving at night, and the odd hitching post mounted to the building begins to make sense when you see the structure in motion. More than a few customers have fallen asleep in one town only to wake up en route to another.',
    'This tavern is built around a hot spring. The central area of this spacious tavern includes an open-air spring where bathers relax in a large pool. Inside, a smaller pool is used by the cooks for low-tech sous vide. Accommodations at this location are extravagant, with renown chefs, far-traveled sommeliers, talented bards, silk sheets, and prices to match.',
    'This tavern is a demiplane. The wealthy owner of this tavern hired a powerful wizard to move the building\'s interior into a demiplane. The outer structure is indeed in the town, but the door is a cleverly disguised portal, with illusion work here and there to keep patrons from getting suspicious. The bouncer at the door seems rather uptight about people not bringing in any portable holes or bags of holding.',
    'This tavern is a weapon shop. This isn\'t a tavern at all — it\'s a weapon store run by a civilized bugbear who speaks very limited common. The bugbear doesn\'t understand the difference between “tavern” and “store”, and will ferociously argue with anyone who tries to inform them of their mistake. The locals quite enjoy the big shopkeep, and recommend that travelers go visit "the best tavern in town!"',
    'This tavern steals blood from its patrons. This tavern is run by a wizard who sells blood to vampires. The wizard drains blood from sleeping guests and passed-out drunks but does not harm them in any other way. Certain drinks are spiked to ensure guests\' memories remain foggy, but some of them find holes in their body or blood spots on their clothes. The food is delicious and accommodations comfortable, but a long stay can leave a guest pale, hollow and tired.',
    'This tavern IS a mimic. This tavern can be found in a variety of locales, as it is alive. This mimic favors wooded areas and is a skilled woodworker... as it is necessary to repair itself after feeding. It is also a capable chef with a passion for knitting- it has spun all its own carpets with its own salivary silk. Someday, a resourceful adventurers might befriend the beast and have access to a moving tavern...',
    'This tavern inducts cultists. The owner is this tavern is a high-ranking officer within a dark cult, and the function of this tavern is to recruit new members. The owner relies on both magic and keen insight to identify customers with the right predisposition to be indoctrinated in the organization. If threatened, the owner will pull a rope, ringing a bell that will summon reinforcements.',
    'This tavern hosts divine beings. This tavern exists both in the mortal and divine realms. Though their true nature is cloaked, many of the patrons are gods in human form. Within these guises they test mortals with trials of worthiness, search for suitable prophets and champions, and give blessings to those who earn their sympathy. Many of the realm\'s demi-gods owe their conception to the tavern.',
    'This tavern is a dragon\'s lair. The walls of this tavern are covered in faded bounty posters, old royal edicts, pages from dated broadsheets, and shelves full of dusty knickknacks and memorabilia. The proprietor, unbeknownst to most, is a polymorphed dragon curious about the \'human\' condition. The tavern hosts a range of events, from somber memorials to unbridled ribaldry, saving choice tokens to add to their hoard. While generally affable, woe betide the wayward soul that disturbs the dragon\'s collection of oddities.',
    'This tavern is a stop for an subterranean railroad. Every so often the peace of this quaint tavern is broken by a strange occurrence; the floor rumbles, there is a loud whistle, and the cellar door is flung open by a boisterous torrent of gnomes, dwarves, and other underground denizens, overburdened by luggage. Loudly complaining of their long journey, the passengers jostle furniture and patrons alike as they make their way out the front door.',
    'This tavern hosts the \'Great Game\'. Within the main room of this tavern stands a large table, inlayed with a map of the world and covered in intricately carved tiles. Efficient servers laden with fine wines, exotic spirits, and rare delicacies pass through the hushed but enthusiastic crowd. Small fortunes are wagered in excited whispers as the enigmatic players take their turns. Upon closer inspection, some of the tiles bear striking resemblances to the adventurers.',
    'This tavern is trapped in a time loop. Unknown forces have trapped this tavern in a time loop. Everyone unfortunate enough to be present at that moment-the guests, the owner, his family and staff- experience the same events each day, though they do not perceive the loop. Their lives play out the same way every day unless acted upon by outsiders who happen to enter the tavern.',
    'This tavern is hosting a murder mystery. Each week, the owners of this tavern act out a murder mystery. Devoted to verisimilitude, they no longer announce the game at the start. And because they utilize illusions to create the appearance of a real homicide, they frequently dupe unsuspecting guests. The tavern has attracted a class of patron who love puzzles and they do their best to play along in seeming ignorance.',
    'This tavern is in a feud with a neighboring one. This tavern and the one next to it have been operated by the same ancient clans for hundreds of years, and the two clans have been embroiled in a feud for almost as long. Long ago, blood was spilt over their anger, but a betrothal between the families\' young heirs has maintained the peace. These young people intend to find their own love elsewhere, opening the door for outsiders to somehow quell or exaggerate the conflict.',
    'This tavern is a giant fungus. The entire structure of this tavern has been overgrown by a form of symbiotic fungus. Stalks sprout from every hole in the woodwork, and every room is lit by an enormous glowing mushroom cap covering the ceiling. In the dining area, patrons can squeeze bulbs to collect a bizarre alcohol, and plump buds can be collected as food. Local diners inform travelers that the proper way to pay for the tavern\'s services is to deposit decaying plant or animal matter in the open maw inside the fireplace.',
    'This tavern conceals an evil temple. The structure of this tavern is little more than a decoy, built atop an eight-level partially buried Yuan-Ti temple. The tavern is mostly staffed with humans, who have been tasked with making sure the crowds are as drunk as possible by midnight. Later, disguised Yuan-Ti purebloods join the crowd, seeking to isolate potential prey and bring them to the temple below. If threatened, they cry for help, bringing swarms of Abominations to aid them.',
    'This tavern can provide visitors with a limited gift of resurrection. Many years ago, a hero performed a heroic act on behalf of a god of life. The god chose to honor that hero by blessing her home, a modest road tavern. Any paying customer who rests for one hour within one of the rented rooms gains a boon of resurrection that lasts for one month. If that being dies within that time, they will wake up the next morning in one of the rooms of the tavern. Each being can receive the boon an unlimited number of times, but can only be resurrected this way once. The nature of the tavern is not widely known.',
    'This tavern saps rest, instead of restoring it. As lovely as this tavern is, it is cursed, and offers no rest to those who visit. Though brightly lit and colorful, heavy air and a somber feeling permeate the walls. The fare looks rich and delicious, but tastes dry, and vaguely ashen. The mattresses, apparently plump and well-stuffed, will leave a body aching and tired in the morning. Characters who attempt to rest here gain one level of exhaustion.'
