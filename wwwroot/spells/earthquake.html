				<ul><li><div class="indent">You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.</div></li><li><div class="indent">The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.</div></li><li><div class="indent">When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</div></li><li><div class="indent">This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.</div></li><li><div class="indent">Fissures. Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.</div></li><li><div class="indent">A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</div></li><li><div class="indent">Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.</div></li></ul>

			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>Use the Earthquake spell to disrupt enemies hiding behind cover, such as walls or pillars, by causing tremors that shake them loose.</li>  <li>When facing enemies that rely on movement, like mounted cavalry or flying creatures, use Earthquake to disrupt their footing and knock them prone.</li>  <li>Earthquake can be especially deadly when used in a confined space, such as a dungeon or narrow canyon, as the shaking can cause collapsed walls and ceilings.</li>  <li>If you are trying to escape pursuit, casting Earthquake can slow down your enemies and buy you time to get away.</li>  <li>Using Earthquake in combination with other area of effect spells such as Fireball or Cone of Cold can create a devastating combo.</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>    <li>Defending a city from an invading army by causing earthquakes that disrupt the enemy's formations and destroy their siege engines.</li>    <li>Creating a distraction during a heist or burglary by causing an earthquake that draws the guards' attention away from the thieves.</li>    <li>Escaping a pursuing enemy by causing an earthquake that causes a landslide, obstructing the enemy's path.</li>    <li>Creating an opening in a dungeon wall by causing an earthquake that causes the stone to crumble away.</li>    <li>Stopping a ritual or summoning by disrupting the ground beneath the enemy spellcaster, causing them to lose their concentration or disrupting the circle.</li></ul>
