Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.</div></li><li><div class="indent">***1.

Yellow.*** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</div></li><li><div class="indent">***4. Green.*** The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</div></li><li><div class="indent">***5. Blue.*** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</div></li><li><div class="indent">***6. Indigo.*** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</div></li><li><div class="indent">***7. Violet.*** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)</div></li><li><div class="indent">***8. Special.*** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.</div></li></ul>

			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>Use Prismatic Spray to deal damage to multiple enemies at once.</li>  <li>Use it to potentially blind, restrain, or reduce the speed of enemies.</li>  <li>Use it to create cover by creating a rainbow-colored mist.</li>  <li>Use it to create distractions, as the bright colors and effects may draw attention away from other actions.</li>  <li>Use it to break through barriers or obstacles by destroying them with the prismatic energy.</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>  <li>Defending against a horde of goblins or other low-level enemies</li>  <li>Breaking through a magical barrier or force field</li>  <li>Confusing a group of enemies to create an opening for a sneak attack</li>  <li>Creating a distraction to help the party escape from a dangerous situation</li>  <li>Disorienting a powerful enemy to give the party an advantage in combat</li></ul>
			<h3>How do you want to do this?:</h3><ul>  <li>As you unleash a Prismatic Spray, the colors of the rainbow surge forth and strike your target with such force that they are moments away from death. Their body begins to glow with a kaleidoscope of colors before exploding in a dazzling display of light.</li>  <li>The Prismatic Spray strikes your enemy with a beam of pure energy, causing them to writhe in agony as they are consumed by the spell's power. Their body crumples to the ground, lifeless and burnt to a crisp.</li>  <li>Your Prismatic Spray strikes true, sending a trail of sparkling, multicolored magic towards your adversary. As they try to dodge and weave, the spell homes in and engulfs them in a shimmering cloud of chaos. When the mist clears, your enemy is nowhere to be seen.</li>  <li>Your opponent is showered with a dazzling array of colors as your Prismatic Spray washes over them. As they struggle to stay on their feet, their eyes widen in fear as the colors begin to swirl into an intense, blinding ball of light. A moment later, the light explodes, and your enemy is gone.</li>  <li>The Prismatic Spray envelops your enemy with a rain of magic missiles, each one a different color and element. The barrage lasts for mere seconds, but when it's done, your foe is nothing but a charred husk, unable to withstand the awesome power of the spell.</li></ul>
