You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.</div></li><li><div class="indent">When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</div></li></ul>

			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>Use Blade Barrier to block off a narrow corridor or entrance, creating an effective barrier that enemies will have trouble walking through.</li>  <li>If you're surrounded by enemies, using Blade Barrier can help protect you from attacks coming in from all sides.</li>  <li>Create a chokepoint with Blade Barrier, funneling enemies into a specific area and making it easier to attack them.</li>  <li>Use Blade Barrier as a way to split up foes, dividing them into smaller groups that are easier to handle.</li>  <li>If you're fighting against a particularly tough enemy or boss, Blade Barrier can help whittle down their health while keeping you safe.</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>  <li>Defending a narrow passage or entrance to prevent enemies from advancing further into your territory</li>  <li>Creating a safe zone for your party to rest within, shielding them from any nearby threats</li>  <li>Using it as a deterrent against a pursuing enemy, forcing them to either turn back or suffer significant damage</li>  <li>Casting it as a surprise attack against a group of enemies, catching them off guard and dealing heavy damage</li>  <li>Blocking off an escape route for a fleeing enemy, leaving them trapped and vulnerable to attack</li></ul>
			<h3>How do you want to do this?:</h3><ul>  <li>A flurry of spinning blades tears through the enemy, leaving them hacked to pieces.</li>  <li>The enemy is encased in a dome of razor-sharp blades, which then collapse inward and shred them to bits.</li>  <li>The blades form a cage around the enemy, piercing and slicing them from all sides until they fall to the ground.</li>  <li>A cluster of blades fly through the air and converge on the enemy, each one piercing their flesh with devastating force.</li>  <li>The enemy is trapped in a vortex of blades, spinning faster and faster until they are completely obliterated.</li>  <li>Dozens of razor-sharp blades rise up from the ground and converge on the enemy, slicing them in every direction until they collapse.</li></ul>
