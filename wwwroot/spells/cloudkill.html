The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.</div></li><li><div class="indent">The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground.
