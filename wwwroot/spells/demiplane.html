				<ul><li><div class="indent">You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.</div></li><li><div class="indent">Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.</div></li></ul>

			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>Use Demiplane as a safe haven for your party during a long rest. It is a pocket dimension that offers protection from harm and unwanted distractions.</li>  <li>Store valuable items, treasures, or even a base of operations inside your Demiplane. It can also function as an extra inventory space for your party.</li>  <li>Escape from dangerous situations by opening a portal to your Demiplane. This can come in handy when you are facing overwhelming enemies or need to retrieve something without getting caught.</li>  <li>Create a maze-like dungeon within your Demiplane as a challenging quest for your party. This can add an exciting twist to your campaign and provide a unique challenge for your players.</li>  <li>Hide out or plan your next move inside your Demiplane without being detected. It is a perfect spot for conducting secretive meetings or crafting your next strategy before heading back into the fray.</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>  <li>Create a safe haven for your party in the middle of a dangerous dungeon using Demiplane.</li>  <li>Store valuable items or treasure in a secure and hidden Demiplane to keep them out of sight from potential thieves or enemies.</li>  <li>Create a secret hideout that only your party can access using Demiplane, allowing you to rest and plan without the risk of being tracked or attacked.</li>  <li>Use Demiplane to lure enemies into a trap by making it appear as though you are retreating, then suddenly transporting them to a demiplane where their escape is impossible.</li>  <li>Set up your own private workshop or laboratory within a Demiplane, where you can experiment with spells or craft new items without any distractions or interruptions.</li></ul>
