			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>In the middle of a tough boss fight to revive multiple fallen allies</li>  <li>After a long rest to top off the party's health before heading into unknown territory</li>  <li>As a last resort to prevent a TPK (Total Party Kill) when things are looking grim</li>  <li>During a siege on a town or outpost to heal a large number of injured civilians or soldiers</li>  <li>In a battle against undead enemies, as Mass Heal also damages them</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>  <li>In a boss battle where multiple party members are low on health</li>  <li>After a party member triggers a trap that causes damage to everyone in the room</li>  <li>To quickly heal a group of NPCs that are vital to completing a quest</li>  <li>During a siege on a city where many soldiers and civilians are wounded</li>  <li>When facing a powerful undead enemy that deals damage to multiple targets at once</li></ul>
