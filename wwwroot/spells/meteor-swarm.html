Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.</div></li><li><div class="indent">The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.</div></li></ul>

			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>Use Meteor Swarm to devastate large groups of enemies in combat.</li>  <li>Use it to target enemies who are hiding behind cover or fortifications.</li>  <li>If you're fighting a boss who is immune to single-target spells, use Meteor Swarm to deal massive area-of-effect damage.</li>  <li>If your party is in a tight spot and needs to escape, use Meteor Swarm to create a diversion and clear a path.</li>  <li>Use it to set fire to an area for strategic purposes, such as clearing a dense forest or blocking off a chokepoint.</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>  <li>To decimate a group of enemy soldiers or monsters during a battle</li>  <li>To destroy a structure or fortress from a distance</li>  <li>To clear a path through a dense jungle or forest by setting it on fire</li>  <li>To create a diversion or distraction by setting different parts of a town or city alight</li>  <li>To take out multiple airships or other aerial enemies at once</li></ul>
			<h3>How do you want to do this?:</h3><ul>  <li>Flames erupt from the ground around the target, igniting their clothing and leaving them screaming in agony.</li>  <li>Meteors smash into the target, pulverizing their body and leaving nothing behind but a smoking crater.</li>  <li>The air around the target crackles with energy as bolts of lightning strike them from every direction, leaving them twitching and smoking on the ground.</li>  <li>Ice shards rain down on the target, encasing them in a frozen tomb that shatters into a million pieces upon impact.</li>  <li>Acid rains down on the target, dissolving them into a puddle of goo that smells strongly of vinegar.</li></ul>
