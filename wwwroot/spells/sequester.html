When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.</div></li><li><div class="indent">If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.</div></li><li><div class="indent">You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.</div></li></ul>
