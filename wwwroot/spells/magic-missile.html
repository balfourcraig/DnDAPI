			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>Use Magic Missile to target enemy spellcasters, as it always hits and can disrupt their concentration.</li>  <li>When dealing with multiple weak enemies, use Magic Missile to mop them up and conserve stronger spells for tougher foes.</li>  <li>During a surprise encounter, use Magic Missile as a first strike to deal damage before the enemy can react.</li>  <li>Combine Magic Missile with a spell that creates darkness or obscures vision, such as Fog Cloud, to make it more difficult for enemies to dodge the incoming missiles.</li>  <li>Use Magic Missile to finish off an enemy that is near death but out of reach of melee attacks.</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>    <li>When you need to attack a target that is far away and difficult to reach</li>    <li>When you want to bypass an enemy's armor or defenses</li>    <li>When you need to deal damage quickly and efficiently</li>    <li>When you are facing multiple enemies at once and need to spread your damage</li>    <li>When you are facing a particularly tough enemy and need to bring them down quickly</li>    <li>When you need to protect yourself or a teammate with a spell that never misses its target</li>    <li>When you want to show off your magical prowess in front of your party members</li></ul>
			<h3>How do you want to do this?:</h3><ul>  <li>A glowing blue missile streaks towards the enemy, striking them in the chest and causing them to crumple to the ground.</li>  <li>As the enemy attempts to dodge, three Magic Missiles converge on their position, striking them with a concussive force that knocks them unconscious.</li>  <li>The Magic Missiles home in on the enemy's weak spot and strike them with deadly accuracy, instantly killing them.</li>  <li>A barrage of Magic Missiles rains down on the enemy, leaving them smoldering with arcane energy and unable to resist any further attacks.</li>  <li>The Magic Missiles surround the enemy, detonating in a brilliant flash of light that leaves them blind and disoriented.</li></ul>
