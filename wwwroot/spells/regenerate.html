			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>Regenerating health after taking damage in combat</li>  <li>Healing party members during a long rest</li>  <li>Reviving fallen allies in battle</li>  <li>Recovering from exhaustion or fatigue</li>  <li>Healing after a particularly difficult or taxing encounter</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>  <li>You have just defeated a powerful enemy, but several of your party members are severely wounded. You use the Regenerate spell to heal them quickly so you can continue your adventure without delay.</li>  <li>Your rogue has been poisoned and is slowly losing consciousness. You cast Regenerate to cure their poison and bring them back to full health.</li>  <li>Your party has been ambushed by a group of trolls. You cast Regenerate to heal the damage they cause and keep your party members alive.</li>  <li>Your party has been exploring an ancient tomb and one of your members was cursed with a disease. You use Regenerate to remove the curse and cure the disease before it spreads to other members.</li>  <li>One of your party members was hit with a powerful spell that drastically reduced their maximum hit points. You use Regenerate to restore their health to its previous level.</li></ul>
