				<ul><li><div class="indent">Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.</div></li><li><div class="indent">If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.</div></li></ul>

			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul><li>Use Heat Metal on an enemy's armor or weapon to force them to drop it or take continuous damage.</li><li>Heat Metal can also be used on a lock to melt it and gain access to a locked area or container.</li><li>If you are trapped in an icy or frozen environment, use Heat Metal on objects or surfaces to melt ice and create a path.</li><li>Heat Metal can be used to damage or destroy structures made of metal, such as bridges or gates.</li><li>When dealing with enemies who are heavily armored, use Heat Metal to weaken them and make them easier to fight.</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul><li>Heating up an enemy's metal weapon or armor, causing them to drop it or take damage.</li><li>Heating up a metal door or gate, causing it to become too hot to touch and potentially forcing it open.</li><li>Using heat metal on your own metal equipment, such as a sword or shield, to make it too hot for enemies to touch or to add extra damage to attacks.</li><li>Creating distractions by heating up random metal objects in a room, such as pots and pans, to draw enemies' attention away from you or your team.</li><li>Flaring up an enemy's metal restraints, such as handcuffs or shackles, to help a captured teammate escape.</li></ul>
			<h3>How do you want to do this?:</h3><ul>  <li>The enemy's armor or weapon becomes too hot to hold or wear, causing them to drop it in pain and leaving them vulnerable.</li>  <li>The metal on the enemy's body heats up to the point of searing their skin, causing a significant amount of damage.</li>  <li>With a strategic casting of Heat Metal on a weapon, the enemy's sword or axe shatters under the extreme heat, leaving them defenseless.</li>  <li>By targeting a metal object in the environment, such as a door or portcullis, the intense heat causes it to melt and block the enemy's escape route.</li>  <li>With a well-placed Heat Metal spell on the enemy's metal shield, it becomes too hot to hold and they drop it, leaving themselves open to attack.</li></ul>
