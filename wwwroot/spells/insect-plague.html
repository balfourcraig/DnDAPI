The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured.

</section>
			
			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul>  <li>When facing large swarms of insects, such as beetles or spiders.</li>  <li>As a distraction to lure enemies away from your party.</li>  <li>In situations where a target is vulnerable to insect bites, such as if they're allergic or have an open wound.</li>  <li>When navigating through tight spaces or underground caves, where there may be more insects present than usual.</li>  <li>As a last resort when facing a particularly difficult enemy, as the insects can distract and weaken them.</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul><li>Defending a large city with a swarm of locusts against an enemy army</li><li>Using the insect plague to disorient and distract a dangerous beast while attempting to capture it</li><li>Covering a retreat or escape by summoning a horde of biting and stinging insects to slow down pursuers</li><li>As a distraction during a stealth operation, sending a swarm of insects to cause chaos and distract guards</li><li>Using the insect plague as a means of torture or intimidation during interrogation</li></ul>
			<h3>How do you want to do this?:</h3><ul>  <li>The swarm of insects converges on the target, biting and stinging them until they collapse from the sheer pain.</li>  <li>The target attempts to swat at the insects, but only succeeds in injuring themselves as they try to get the bugs off of them.</li>  <li>The insects swarm into the target's mouth and nose, suffocating them from the inside as they struggle to breathe.</li>  <li>The target becomes covered in so many insects that they are blinded and disoriented, making them an easy target for a final strike.</li>  <li>The swarm of insects consumes the target's flesh, leaving only bones behind as they are reduced to a pile of dust.</li></ul>
