If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</div></li><li><div class="indent">If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.</div></li><li><div class="indent">If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.</div></li></ul>
