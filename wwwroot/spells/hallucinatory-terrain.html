				<ul><li><div class="indent">You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.</div></li><li><div class="indent">The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.</div></li></ul>

			<h3>General Tips:</h3><ul><li>Tricking enemies into thinking they're walking on solid ground, when in reality it's a deep pit or sharp spikes</li><li>Covering the party's tracks by making it look like they didn't travel in a certain direction</li><li>Creating a false path that leads enemies away from the party's actual destination</li><li>Turning a dangerous terrain into something harmless, like a bed of flowers instead of a bed of thorns</li><li>Creating a distracting sight or sound to draw attention away from the party's actions</li></ul>
			<h3>Interesting Scenarios:</h3><ul>  <li>Creating a false wall or hiding spot to avoid being detected by enemies while trying to sneak through a dungeon.</li>  <li>Concealing a trap or hazard, making it appear as if the ground is safe to walk on.</li>  <li>Casting the spell on an enemy's feet, causing them to become disoriented and lose their sense of direction in a chase or battle.</li>  <li>Using it as a distraction, drawing attention away from yourself or allies so that you can slip by unnoticed.</li>  <li>Disguising yourself and your surroundings to better blend in with your surroundings for stealth missions or infiltration.</li></ul>
